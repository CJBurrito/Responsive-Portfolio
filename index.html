          <p>Hi, I'm Christian, a 24 year old living in Charlotte, NC. I currently work in the accounting department at
            AmWINS in Southpark,
            an insurance wholesaler. My free time is spent making music and jamming with friends, and playing video
            games every so often.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>I was born in Long Beach, CA, and lived in the LA basin for the first 21 years of my life. The move to
            North Carolina
            was instigated by the purchase of the company I worked for at the time. Our purchaser had their accounting
            headquarters in
            Charlotte, and my family decided we'd try and take the plung and move across the country.
          </p>
          <p>I am currently taking a coding bootcamp class at UNC Charlotte to get into a new carrier and possibly find
            something that I
            really truly love.
          </p>
